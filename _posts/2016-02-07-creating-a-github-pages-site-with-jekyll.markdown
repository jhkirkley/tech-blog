This is the start of my tech blog so I thought why not describe the steps it took to create it? The tasks were trivial maybe but not obvious.

Here goes:

* install Ruby
* install Bundler
* install Jekyll


Go to the directory where you want to put your site directory
{% highlight bash %}
$ jekyll new your-site-name
$ cd your-site-name
$ git init
$ git commit -m "initial"
{% endhighlight %}

Create a Gemfile

Add

{% highlight ruby %}
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'github-pages'
{% endhighlight %}

Run
{% highlight bash %}
$bundle install
{% endhighlight %}

To see that the install went correctly run

{% highlight bash %}
$bundle exec jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

Go to your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4000/.

You will see a generic Jekyll page. you can start personalizing the site by editing the _config.yml. [The official instructions are pretty good][github-config]


To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
